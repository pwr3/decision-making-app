This is a simple showcase app that I am working on in my free time.

## The Idea
In summary, this is a brainstorming app that allows you to **clearly see how to solve your problem or issue** by decomposing it into solutions (options) and analyzing these options using arguments. ðŸ¤“

## How it works?!

Have a problem that needs to be solved, but it's not that easy?

#### 1. Try to define the problem (Issue)

In the next window, you can add more detailed description of this problem if it is more complicated.

> Problem or issue is not as well solved as we would like, mainly because it takes several "layers" to solve. This is how out brain works...

#### 2. Add options one by one using the "Add Option" form

So, the next step is to brainstorm and create a list of potential solutions (options) **without considering whether they are suitable or not**. The important thing to focus on at this stage is simply generating ideas, rather than evaluating their feasibility.

#### 3. Add reasons

And **only now (!)**, go through each option one by one and consider the **pros** and **cons** or **neutral** points (reasons) with respect to the main problem.

The program will now analyze the data and provide a percentage breakdown of which solution is the best choice and which ones are not as effective.

I hope this helps you. ðŸ˜ƒ

*I don't want to present myself as an expert in this solution, but I have personally found that periodically considering it and using this method often helps me to focus and make the most logical decision.*
